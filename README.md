# Prisoner-Game-University-Project
This project is a simple Java implementation of a turn-based Prisoner Game, developed for educational purposes. The goal of the project is to practice object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism,
and separation of responsibilities between classes.

The program simulates a game where different types of players participate, including human-controlled players and computer-controlled players. Each player follows specific rules and behaviors during the game rounds.
The main class of the project is PrisonerGame.java. When the program starts, it prompts the user with the following message: 'Do you want to play 1. Human vs Computer, or 2. Computer vs Computer? '. Based on the user’s
selection, the appropriate game mode is initialized. The game then proceeds through a series of rounds, which are handled by the game logic. At the end of each game, the program displays the winner. The user is then asked
whether they would like to continue playing, using the prompt: 'Do you want to play another round [y,n]? '. If the user chooses to continue, a new round starts; otherwise, the program terminates and writes the winner again.

All interaction and output are handled through the console, and no graphical user interface is used. The project was created and is intended to be run using the Eclipse IDE.
